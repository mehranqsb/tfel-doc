	abstract = {It is shown that for problems involving rate constitutive equations, such as rate-independent elastoplasticity, the notion of consistency between the tangent (stiffness) operator and the integration algorithm employed in the solution of the incremental problem, plays a crucial role in preserving the quadratic rate of asymptotic convergence of iterative solution schemes based upon Newton's method. Within the framework of closest-point-projection algorithms, a methodology is presented whereby tangent operators consistent with this class of algorithms may be systematically developed. To wit, associative J2 flow rules with general nonlinear kinematic and isotropic hardening rules, as well as a class of non-associative flow rules are considered. The resulting iterative solution scheme preserves the asymptotic quadratic convergence characteristic of Newton's method, whereas use of the socalled elastoplastic tangent in conjunction with a radial return integration algorithm, a procedure often employed, results in Newton type of algorithms with suboptimal rate of convergence. Application is made to a set of numerical examples which include saturation hardening laws of exponential type.},

	abstract = {The local and overall responses of nonlinear composites are classically investigated by the Finite Element Method. We propose an alternate method based on Fourier series which avoids meshing and which makes direct use of microstructure images. It is based on the exact expression of the Green function of a linear elastic and homogeneous comparison material. First, the case of elastic nonhomogeneous constituents is considered and an iterative procedure is proposed to solve the Lippman-Schwinger equation which naturally arises in the problem. Then, the method is extended to non-linear constituents by a step-by-step integration in time. The accuracy of the method is assessed by varying the spatial resolution of the microstructures. The flexibility of the method allows it to serve for a large variety of microstructures.},

Engineering and mathematics are in a reasonable balance: After the simplest possible, intuitive approach follows the mathematical formulation and analysis. Computational methods occupy a good portion of the book. There are several worked out problems in each chapter and additional exercises at the end of the book. Very often, mathematical expressions are given in more than one notation. The book is intended primarily for students and practising engineers in mechanical and civil engineering. Most of them will be faced with problems of advanced materials and should have a correct understanding of the basic ideas even if they use software to solve them. Students or experts from applied mathematics, materials science and other related fields will also find it useful."--BOOK JACKET.},
