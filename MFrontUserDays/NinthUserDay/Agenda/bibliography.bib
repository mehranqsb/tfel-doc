	abstract = {This paper provides an overview of the Licos fuel performance code which has been developed for several years within the platform pleiades, co-developed by the French Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission ({CEA}) and its industrial partners Électricité de France ({EDF}) and {AREVA}.

{CEA} engineers have been using Licos to back multidimensional thermo-mechanical studies on innovative fuel elements design and experimental device pre-and post-irradiation computations. Studies made with Licos thus encompass a wide range of situations, including most nuclear systems used or studied in France in recent years ({PWR}, {SFR} or {GFR}), normal and off-normal operating conditions, and a large selection of materials (either for fuel, absorber, coolant and cladding).

The aim of this paper is to give some insights about some innovative features in the design of Licos (dependency management, kriging, mfront, etc.). We also present two studies that demonstrate the flexibility of this code. The first one shows how Licos can be combined with the Germinal monodimensional fuel performance code to demonstrate the interest of a three dimensional modelling of the fuel relocation phenomenon in the Sodium Fast Reactor fuel pin. The second one describes how Licos was used to model the {DIAMINO} experiment.},

	abstract = {In the paper, the microplane material model for concrete based on the relaxed kinematic constraint is presented. The model is aimed to be used for three-dimensional damage and fracture analysis of concrete and reinforced concrete structures in the framework of smeared crack approach. In the microplane model, the material is characterized by a relation between the stress and strain components on planes of various orientations. These planes may be imagined to represent the damage planes or weak planes in the microstructure, such as contact layers between aggregate pieces in concrete. The tensorial invariance restrictions need not be directly enforced. They are automatically satis®ed by superimposing in a suitable manner the responses from all the microplanes. To realistically model concrete under compressive load, for each microplane, the total strain tensor has to be decomposed into the normal (volumetric and deviatoric) and shear strain component. It is shown that for dominant tensile load the decomposition of the normal microplane strain into volumetric and deviatoric part, together with the fact that the tensile strength of concrete is an order of magnitude smaller than it's compressive strength, leads to unrealistic model response. To keep the conceptual simplicity, the model is improved in the framework of the kinematic microplane theory, however, the kinematic constraint at the microplane level is relaxed. The proposed approach ®nds its physical background in the discontinuity of the strain ®eld. It is demonstrated that the improved model correctly predicts the concrete response for dominant tensile load. The implementation of the initial anisotropy and the modeling of concrete for cyclic loading is also discussed. Comparison with a number of test data for dierent stress±strain histories shows a good agreement. The model has been recently implemented into a two- and three-dimensional ®nite element code and coupled with the localization limiter of local (crack band) and nonlocal integral type.

	abstract = {Mathematical modeling of the nonlinear triaxial behavior and damage of such a complex material as concrete has been a long-standing challenge in which progress has been made only in gradual increments. The goal of this study is a realistic and robust material model for explicit ﬁnite-element programs for concrete structures that computes the stress tensor from the given strain tensor and some history variables. The microplane models, which use a constitutive equation in a vectorial rather than tensorial form and are semimultiscale by virtue of capturing interactions among phenomena of different orientation, can serve this goal effectively. This paper presents a new concrete microplane model, M7, which achieves this goal much better than the previous versions M1–M6 developed at Northwestern University since 1985. The basic mathematical structure of M7 is logically correlated to thermodynamic potentials for the elastic regime, the tensile and compressive damage regimes, and the frictional slip regime. Given that the volumetric-deviatoric (V-D) split of strains is inevitable for distinguishing between compression failures at low and high conﬁnement, the key idea is to apply the V-D split only to the microplane compressive stress-strain boundaries (or strain-dependent yield limits), the sum of which is compared with the total normal stress from the microplane constitutive relation. This avoids the use of the V-D split of the elastic strains and of the tensile stress-strain boundary, which caused various troubles in M3–M6 such as excessive lateral strains and stress locking in far postpeak uniaxial extension, poor representation of unloading and loading cycles, and inability to represent high dilatancy under postpeak compression in lower-strength concretes. Moreover, the differences between high hydrostatic compression and compressive uniaxial strain are accurately captured by considering the compressive volumetric boundary as dependent on the principal strain difference. The model is veriﬁed extensively in the companion paper. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)EM.1943-7889.0000570. © 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

	abstract = {The paper presents a new microplane constitutive model for the inelastic behavior of jointed rock masses that takes into account the mechanical behavior and geometric characteristics of cracks and joints. The basic idea is that the microplane modeling of rock masses under general triaxial loading, including compression, requires the isotropic rock matrix and the joints to be considered as two distinct phases coupled in parallel. A joint continuity factor is deﬁned as a microplane damage variable to represent the stress-carrying area fraction of the joint phase. Based on the assumption of parallel coupling between the rock joint and the rock matrix, the overall mechanical behavior of the rock is characterized by microplane constitutive laws for the rock matrix and for the rock joints, along with an evolution law for the microplane joint continuity factor. The inelastic response of the rock matrix and the rock joints is controlled on the microplane level by the stress–strain boundaries. Based on the arguments enunciated in developing the new microplane model M7 for concrete, the previously used volumetric–deviatoric splits of the elastic strains and of the tensile boundary are avoided. The boundaries are tensile normal, compressive normal, and shear. The numerical simulations demonstrate satisfactory ﬁts of published triaxial test data on sandstone and on jointed plaster mortar, including quintessential features such as the strain softening and dilatancy under low conﬁning pressure, as well as the brittle–ductile transition under higher conﬁning pressure, and the decrease of jointed rock strength and Young’s modulus with an increasing dip angle of the joint.

The ﬁrst is the mathematical description of local response for such a heterogeneous material under all stress states, and the second is the stability and efﬁciency of the numerical implementation in ﬁnite element codes. The paper at hand presents a comprehensive approach addressing both issues. Adopting the microplane theory, a combined plasticity–damage model is formulated and regularized by an implicit gradient enhancement. The plasticity part introduces a new microplane smooth 3-surface cap yield function, which provides a stable numerical solution within an implicit ﬁnite element algorithm. The damage part utilizes a split, which can describe the transition of loading between tension and compression. Regularization of the model by the implicit gradient approach eliminates the mesh sensitivity and numerical instabilities. Identiﬁcation methods for model parameters are proposed and several numerical examples of plain and reinforced concrete are carried out for illustration.},

	abstract = {The paper addresses the microplane model in the context of localization analysis. Capable of reproducing experimental results of concrete specimens, the microplane model includes anisotropic damage in a natural and conceptually simple and explicit way. However, the eﬃciency of former microplane implementations suﬀers from the expense of the solution procedure being based on the secant stiﬀness method. Within this paper, the macroscopic constitutive equation derived by kinematically constraining the microplane strains to the macroscopic strain tensor is consistently linearized resulting in quadratic convergence of the Newton—Raphson iteration for the equilibrium equations. A fully three-dimensional model will be presented and linearized incorporating the two-dimensional case in a natural fashion. Furthermore, the localization criterion is analysed, indicating locally the onset of localization in terms of the acoustic tensor. Several examples demonstrate the features of the microplane model in predicting the material behaviour of concrete in tension and compression as well as in shear. 1998 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {The main objective of the present work is to provide a general framework for constitutive laws based on the microplane theory applicable to any kind of rheological behavior. Therefore, a thermodynamically consistent concept of deriving microplane based constitutive equations is presented. Microscopic constitutive laws are formulated on characteristic material planes, the so-called microplanes, resulting in an overall anisotropic macroscopic material characterization. The microscopic strain components of one plane are derived by the projection of the macroscopic strain tensor, leading to a kinematically constrained model. As proposed in the ®rst part of this paper, the introduction of individual potentials on each microplane yields thermodynamically consistent microplane laws. They can be related to the macroscopic material description through an integration over the hemisphere. The microplane laws are chosen such that the macroscopic version of the Clausius±Duhem inequality is satis®ed. This generic concept will be applied to the classical models of elasticity, elasto-damage and elasto-plasticity. The results are documented by the analysis of pointwise texture evolution for the model problems of uniaxial tension and simple shear. Ó 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Both models are based on a decreasing interaction length upon decreasing stresses and do not require additional model parameters or extra degrees of freedom when compared to standard gradient-enhanced models. It is observed that with the proposed models damage spreading is significantly reduced due to the occurrence of non-physical oscillations in the nonlocal strain field near the strain localization band. Model improvements to eliminate these strain oscillations upon vanishing length scale values are proposed. The capability of the models and their patched versions to correctly simulate damage initiation and propagation is investigated by means of mode-I failure, shear band and fourpoint bending tests.},

The proposed formulation naturally fits in the so-called nonlocal standard approach, whereby the framework of generalized standard materials is extended to include gradients of internal variables to account for the physics of the fracture phenomenon in a regularized sense, that is, via extended constitutive equations in which a length scale parameter brings to the macro level information about material microstructure. This concept is fully embodied into the present approach to quasi-brittle fracture, whereby progressive damage occurs in layers of finite thickness where the gradient of damage is bounded and a fully damaged region is understood as a fracture with no ambiguity. Key to the effective implementation of the model are the choice of two constitutive functions and the implicit tracking of regions in a state of progressive damage via Lagrange multipliers acting on internal constraints. The ideas are developed for a general Cauchy continuum and representative numerical simulations are included that demonstrate the model capabilities.},

	abstract = {In its numerical implementation, the variational approach to brittle fracture approximates the crack evolution in an elastic solid through the use of gradient damage models. In the present paper, we ﬁrst formulate the quasi-static evolution problem for a general class of such damage models. Then, we introduce a stability criterion in terms of the positivity of the second derivative of the total energy under the unilateral constraint induced by the irreversibility of damage. These concepts are applied in the particular setting of a one-dimensional traction test. That allows us to construct homogeneous as well as localized damage solutions in a closed form and to illustrate the concepts of loss of stability, of scale eﬀects, of damage localization, and of structural failure. Considering several speciﬁc constitutive models, stress-displacement curves, stability diagrams, and energy dissipation provide identiﬁcation criteria for the relevant material parameters, such as limit stress and internal length. Finally, the one-dimensional analytical results are compared with the numerical solution of the evolution problem in a two dimensional setting.},

	abstract = {The description of localisation and structural failure through local damage constitutive laws leads to illposed problems. To retrieve a well-posed problem, the material state is described through the gradients of damage in addition to the strain and the damage. Under some assumptions, it is shown that these gradient laws can be cast into a variational formulation. Its numerical treatment is reduced to the design of a mixed ﬁnite element so that algorithms such as Newton’s method and path-following techniques are still available. Possible convergence difﬁculties related to the reduction of the damage band width and the appearance of micro instabilities are removed thanks to the design of a new class of brittle laws. Finally, numerical applications show the convergence with mesh reﬁnement, the compatibility with coarser approaches such as Grifﬁth’s theory and cohesive crack models, the robustness in case of unstable multi-cracking, the applicability to full-scale 3D situations and the physical relevance compared to experimental data.},

The difficulties arise from an uncontrolled mesh dependence caused by damage localization and an increase in computational costs. One of the solutions to the first problem, widely used to predict the failure of metallic materials, consists of using non-local damage constitutive equations. The second difficulty can then be solved using specific finite element formulations, such as shell element, which decrease the number of degrees of freedom. The main contribution of this paper consists of extending these techniques to layered materials such as polymer matrix composites. An extension of the non-local implicit gradient formulation, accounting for anisotropy and stratification, and an original layered shell element, based on a new partition of the unity, are proposed. Finally the efficiency of the resulting numerical scheme is studied by comparing simulation with experimental results.},

	title = {A thermodynamically consistent formulation of nonlocal and gradient plasticity},
	volume = {25},
	issn = {0093-6413},
	abstract = {A non-associative implicit gradient pressure-dependent softening plasticity model and its numerical implementation are presented to capture strain localization in soils. The thermodynamically consistent framework of the generalized micro-morphic approach by Forest (2009) is adopted. A micro-variable is introduced to serve as an additional kinematic variable; the micro-force balance containing higher-order generalized stresses is derived using the virtual power method, and it is then converted into a coupled Helmholtz equation by applying the second law of thermodynamics. The pressure dependency for applications in soils is further considered using a hyperbolic yield function, and a regularized non-associative constitutive model is formulated. Numerically, the Jacobian matrix is obtained by linearizing the residual vector and a finite element procedure coupling both displacements and micro-variable is implemented. The applicability of the proposed methodology to capture strain softening response accompanied by localized shear bands is verified using two numerical examples, and the computed numerical solutions exhibit excellent mesh-independent results. The plastic dissipation analysis further verifies the ability of the proposed model to regularize ill-posed boundary value problems induced by material softening. The influence of key parameters on the simulations and the effects of strain softening on the bearing behavior of soils are illustrated.
The paper presents a comprehensive experimental and numerical analysis of slender rectangular reinforced concrete beams with longitudinal BFRP bars without shear reinforcement subjected to 3-point bending. The experiments included 4 different beams which were similar in two directions. The main research objective was to investigate the size effect on the nominal shear strength of beams. The detailed experimental analysis of beam strength, failure mode and cracking evolution was presented and compared with previous test results on beams reinforced by ordinary steel bears. The experiments with BFRP bars were numerically reproduced using the 2D finite element method based on a coupled elastic-plastic-damage formulation. In order to describe strain localization in concrete, a non-local constitutive model was applied with account for a characteristic length of micro-structure developing in the softening regime. The numerical results were in satisfactory agreement with the experimental data. Advantages and disadvantages of BFRP reinforcement in concrete beams were next outlined.
A multi-scale model, based on the concept of Representative Volume Element (RVE), is proposed linking a classical continuum at RVE level to a macro-scale strain-gradient theory. The multi-scale model accounts for the effect of body forces and inertia phenomena occurring at the micro-scale. The Method of Multiscale Virtual Power recently proposed by the authors drives the construction of the model. In this context, the coupling between the macro- and micro-scale kinematical descriptors is defined by means of kinematical insertion and homogenisation operators, carefully postulated to ensure kinematical conservation in the scale transition. Micro-scale equilibrium equations as well as formulae for the homogenised (macro-scale) force- and stress-like quantities are naturally derived from the Principle of Multiscale Virtual Power – a variational extension of the Hill-Mandel Principle that enforces the balance of the virtual powers of both scales. As an additional contribution, further insight into the theory is gained with the enforcement of the RVE kinematical constraints by means of Lagrange multipliers. This approach unveils the reactive nature of homogenised force- and stress-like quantities and allows the characterisation of the homogenised stress-like quantities exclusively in terms of RVE boundary data in a straightforward manner.
The effect of fluctuating local tensile strength on a coupled energetic–statistical size effect in plain concrete beams under bending was numerically investigated. First, the influence of varying autocorrelation length of the random field describing a spatial variation of local tensile strength was studied. Next, the influence of the coefficient of variation of local tensile strength was analyzed. The numerical FE investigations were performed for unnotched concrete beams of similar geometry under quasi-static three point bending within elasto-plastic model assumptions, accounting for non-local softening. The FE analyses were carried out for four different beam sizes. In the calculations, the tensile strength took the form of spatially correlated random field described by a Gaussian distribution.
The paper presents results of FE analysis of mechanical size effects in longitudinally reinforced concrete slender beams without shear reinforcement failing in shear mode. The simulations were performed under plane stress conditions for three beams of different sizes and a fixed shape (height/length ratio). The attention was focused on deterministic and statistical size effects related to the nominal beam shear strength. Concrete was assumed as an isotropic elasto-plastic material exhibiting non-local softening. The bond strength between concrete and reinforcement was assumed to depend on interface slip with both stable and softening responses. Statistical simulations were performed for spatially correlated Gaussian random fields of tensile strength using a stratified sampling reduction method. The FE numerical results were compared with the respective own experimental test results.
A non-local gradient-based damage formulation within a geometrically non-linear setting is presented. The hyperelastic constitutive response at local material point level is governed by a strain energy which is additively composed of an isotropic matrix and of an anisotropic fibre-reinforced material, respectively. The inelastic constitutive response is governed by a scalar [1–d]-type damage formulation, where only the anisotropic elastic part is assumed to be affected by the damage. Following the concept in Dimitrijević and Hackl [28], the local free energy function is enhanced by a gradient-term. This term essentially contains the gradient of the non-local damage variable which, itself, is introduced as an additional independent variable. In order to guarantee the equivalence between the local and non-local damage variable, a penalisation term is incorporated within the free energy function. Based on the principle of minimum total potential energy, a coupled system of Euler–Lagrange equations, i.e., the balance of linear momentum and the balance of the non-local damage field, is obtained and solved in weak form. The resulting coupled, highly non-linear system of equations is symmetric and can conveniently be solved by a standard incremental-iterative Newton–Raphson-type solution scheme. Several three-dimensional displacement- and force-driven boundary value problems—partially motivated by biomechanical application—highlight the mesh-objective characteristics and constitutive properties of the model and illustratively underline the capabilities of the formulation proposed.},

  abstract = {Phase-field models are frequently adopted to simulate fracture mechanics problems in the context of the finite element method. To depict fracture, this method involves solving a coupled set of Helmholtz-like damage-field equation and augmented linear momentum balance equation. Solutions to these coupled equations are then used as descriptions of crack propagation phenomena within solids. However, this method imposes a constrain of using extremely fine meshing for properly predicting cracks. For practical problems of interest, this very often leads to linear systems with large sizes that have to be repetitively assembled and solved. As such, iterative solution procedures such as the Krylov subspace-based methods for solving these large linear systems within the framework of serial/parallel computing environments become mandatory to obtain results in a feasible time. In this work, the vectorial finite discretization for a hybrid phase-field formulation – a monolithic solving scheme – is presented. The underlying nonlinearity present in the coupled set of equations of the hybrid phase-field model is dealt through Picard iteration that helps to preserve the symmetry of the linearized system to solve. Due to the symmetric positive definite nature of the finite element linear systems obtained for this problem, the conjugate gradient method makes a standard choice of iterative solution algorithm. In this article, to improve convergence rates, consequently time to solution, of the conjugate gradient method applied to crack propagation problems, different preconditioning strategies are analyzed, tuned, and discussed. Brittle fracture benchmarks are used to measure the performance of preconditioners which are then applied to massively parallel simulations with millions of unknowns. A series of numerical experiments show that the algebraic multigrid preconditioner is well suited for solving the phase-field model for fracture, being superior to the Jacobi and the block Jacobi preconditioning in all regards: ease of solving the problem, iterations to converge, time to solution, and parallel scaling on more than a thousand processes.},

However, non-linearity, the requirement of extremely fine meshing, and/or large-scale simulations make numerical crack prediction a tedious task with this family of models. Such problems demand enormous computational resources. Under a sequential computing framework, these lead to extremely slow computations with non-feasible computer processing times. As a remedy, domain decomposition approaches that facilitate parallel computing can subdue these issues and significantly decrease computational time and memory. This contribution discusses and compares two ways of setting up domain decomposition for phase-field models under a distributed computing framework. Notably, in the context of parallel computing, a monolithic strategy set up via the vectorial finite elements is compared to a staggered finite element strategy for a hybrid phase-field model. A detailed comparison of performance, scalability, and efficiency on thousands of parallel processors is established for a large-scale fracture mechanics problem with millions of unknowns.},

The continuum is regularised through the introduction of gradient terms into the constitutive equations. At the transition to discrete failure, the problem fields are enhanced through a discontinuous interpolation based on the partition of unity paradigm of finite-element shape functions. The inclusion of internal discontinuity surfaces, where boundary conditions are applied without modifications of the original finite-element mesh, avoids the unrealistic damage growth typical of this class of regularised continuum models. Combined models allow for the analysis of the entire failure process, from diffuse microcracking to localised macrocracks. The discretisation procedure is described in detail and numerical examples illustrate the performance of the combined continuous–discontinuous approach.}

  abstract = {This paper investigates the hypothesis that localization of deformation into a shear band may be considered a result of an instability in the constitutive description of homogeneous deformation. General conditions for a bifurcation, corresponding to the localization of deformation into a planar band, are derived. Although the analysis is general and applications to other localization phenomena are noted, the constitutive relations which are examined in application of the criterion for localization are intended to model the behavior of brittle rock masses under compressive principal stresses. These relations are strongly pressure-sensitive since inelasticity results from frictional sliding on an array of fissures; the resulting inelastic response is dilatant, owing to uplift in sliding at asperities and to local tensile cracking from fissure tips. The appropriate constitutive descriptions involve non-normality of plastic strain increments to the yield hyper-surface. Also, it is argued that the subsequent yield surfaces will develop a vertex-like structure. Both of these features are shown to be destabilizing and to strongly influence the resulting predictions for localization by comparison to predictions based on classical plasticity idealizations, involving normality and smooth yield surfaces. These results seem widely applicable to discussions of the inception of rupture as a constitutive instability.},
