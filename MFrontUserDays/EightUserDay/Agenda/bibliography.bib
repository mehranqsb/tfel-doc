	abstract = {The present paper deals with the dimensional variations of limestone aggregates, cement paste, mortar, and High Performance Concrete ({HPC}) made with these constituents, when subjected to temperature changes in drying and sealed conditions. Variable water contents are studied for each material. The overall experimental results were obtained using strain gauges and Digital Image Correlation technique ({DIC}) is also applied for one configuration test. A significant difference between coefficients of Thermal Expansion ({CTE}) of cement paste and aggregate is observed, which leads to a large differential thermal deformation, able to explain thermal damage for temperatures between 50 °C and 100 °C. Water content has a great influence on material thermal dilation, causing delayed deformations especially for temperatures above 60 °C and for initially saturated samples. These experimental data may allow Thermo-Hydro-Mechanical models to be improved so that the in-situ long term behaviour of concrete can finally be predicted. The results confirm the dilation coefficient contrast between paste and aggregate, and also show that this contrast is markedly affected by the drying conditions and the initial state of saturation.},

In this model, water expands in the smaller pores and diffuses progressively to the capillary pores at the upper scale. It is then shown that the water overpressure in smaller pores and the duration of the diffusion process between the two scales of porosity control the {TTD}. It is also shown that creep or shrinkage before the temperature transition mitigates {TTD}. The aim is to provide a model able to predict the conditions for {TTD} to appear and the amplitude of the {TTD} under various thermo-mechanical conditions.

In particular, a link between continuum and discrete approaches to the strain localization phenomena is obtained. Applications to standard continuum damage and elastoplastic constitutive equations are presented. Relevant aspects to be considered in the numerical simulation of the problem (tackled in Part 2 of the work) are also presented.},

	abstract = {The network of sub-boundaries formed in a sintered {UO}2 pellet after dislocational creep was examined. Very low angle boundaries, down to 0.1° were reliably detected by Electron {BackScattered} Diffraction ({EBSD}). This angular resolution was achieved by optimizing {EBSD} data collection and processing. Moreover, Accurate-Electron Channeling Contrast Imaging (Accurate-{ECCI}) was able to image the dislocations produced by creep, directly on the bulk sample. The dislocations were mostly organized in sub-boundaries with low energy configurations. Only a limited number of isolated dislocations were observed. Finally, the deformation substructure obtained after 8\% creep deformation (at 1500°C under a 50MPa uniaxial state) was quantified. The original grains with a mean size of 20μm were in average fragmented in sub-grains of about 5μm. The geometrically necessary dislocations density ({GND}) was evaluated from the filtered {EBSD} data to 7.9×1012m−2. This value was 10 times higher than that measured on the as-sintered sample. This confirms that the {GND} density calculation is sensitive to the dislocation increase after 8\% deformation by creep.},

	abstract = {This work represents an attempt at developing a continuum theory of the elastic–plastic response of single crystals with structural dimensions of ∼100μm or less, based on ideas rooted in the theory of continuously distributed dislocations. The constitutive inputs of the theory relate explicitly to dislocation velocity, dislocation generation and crystal elasticity. Constitutive nonlocality is a natural consequence of the physical considerations of the model. The theory reduces to the nonlinear elastic theory of continuously distributed dislocations in the case of a nonevolving dislocation distribution in the material and the nonlinear theory of elasticity in the absence of dislocations. A geometrically linear version of the theory is also developed. The work presented in this paper is intended to be of use in the prediction of time-dependent mechanical response of bodies containing a single, a few, or a distribution of dislocations. A few examples are solved to illustrate the recovery of conventional results and physically expected ones within the theory. Based on the theory of exterior differential equations, a nonsingular solution for stress/strain fields of a screw dislocation in an infinite, isotropic, linear elastic solid is derived. A solution for an infinite, neo-Hookean nonlinear elastic continuum is also derived. Both solutions match with existing results outside the core region. Bounded solutions are predicted within the core in both cases. The edge dislocation in the isotropic, linear theory is also discussed in the context of this work. Assuming a constant dislocation velocity for simplifying the analysis, an evolutionary solution resulting in a slip-step on the boundary of a stress-free crystal produced due to the passage and exit of an edge dislocation is also described.},
