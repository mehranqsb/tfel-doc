	abstract = {The network of sub-boundaries formed in a sintered {UO}2 pellet after dislocational creep was examined. Very low angle boundaries, down to 0.1° were reliably detected by Electron {BackScattered} Diffraction ({EBSD}). This angular resolution was achieved by optimizing {EBSD} data collection and processing. Moreover, Accurate-Electron Channeling Contrast Imaging (Accurate-{ECCI}) was able to image the dislocations produced by creep, directly on the bulk sample. The dislocations were mostly organized in sub-boundaries with low energy configurations. Only a limited number of isolated dislocations were observed. Finally, the deformation substructure obtained after 8\% creep deformation (at 1500°C under a 50MPa uniaxial state) was quantified. The original grains with a mean size of 20μm were in average fragmented in sub-grains of about 5μm. The geometrically necessary dislocations density ({GND}) was evaluated from the filtered {EBSD} data to 7.9×1012m−2. This value was 10 times higher than that measured on the as-sintered sample. This confirms that the {GND} density calculation is sensitive to the dislocation increase after 8\% deformation by creep.},

	abstract = {This work represents an attempt at developing a continuum theory of the elastic–plastic response of single crystals with structural dimensions of ∼100μm or less, based on ideas rooted in the theory of continuously distributed dislocations. The constitutive inputs of the theory relate explicitly to dislocation velocity, dislocation generation and crystal elasticity. Constitutive nonlocality is a natural consequence of the physical considerations of the model. The theory reduces to the nonlinear elastic theory of continuously distributed dislocations in the case of a nonevolving dislocation distribution in the material and the nonlinear theory of elasticity in the absence of dislocations. A geometrically linear version of the theory is also developed. The work presented in this paper is intended to be of use in the prediction of time-dependent mechanical response of bodies containing a single, a few, or a distribution of dislocations. A few examples are solved to illustrate the recovery of conventional results and physically expected ones within the theory. Based on the theory of exterior differential equations, a nonsingular solution for stress/strain fields of a screw dislocation in an infinite, isotropic, linear elastic solid is derived. A solution for an infinite, neo-Hookean nonlinear elastic continuum is also derived. Both solutions match with existing results outside the core region. Bounded solutions are predicted within the core in both cases. The edge dislocation in the isotropic, linear theory is also discussed in the context of this work. Assuming a constant dislocation velocity for simplifying the analysis, an evolutionary solution resulting in a slip-step on the boundary of a stress-free crystal produced due to the passage and exit of an edge dislocation is also described.},
